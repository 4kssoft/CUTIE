The project is refreshed with all history removed. All programs are runnable expect that the data example is not uploaded.

Since the project was built in my previous workplace, the data format can not be uploaded without permission right now. However, you may infer the correct data format from the data_loader_json.py file. Pull request is welcomed for making the project runnable out of the box.
